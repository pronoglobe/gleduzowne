# gleduzowne

vscode, for video editors

## Background

Having switched from Video editing to programming, I had less time for content creation hence the need for an automation tool to make it easier with lesser effort.

## Integrations

Gleduzowne integrates well with manimgl projects, and it uses ffmpeg under the hood.
That being said, Gleduzowne exhibits a natural bias towards mathematics and science based animations. Because that is what I do mostly on Gleduzowne youtube channel.

## Getting Started

You can download your preferred app from the releases

## Contributing

Gleduzowne is forever open source, feel free to contribute your ideas. Thanks!!!
